# Assignment 2: Deep Learning (2AMM10)

This repository contains the second assignment for the Deep Learning course (2AMM10) for the academic year 2023-2024. The focus of this assignment is on using machine learning to simulate molecular dynamics, specifically targeting the behavior of a new theoretical 2D zeolite.

The assignment is divided into three main tasks:
1. **Energy Prediction**: Modeling the energy of a system of atoms in a periodic, cubic unit cell without the crystal.
2. **Molecular Dynamics with Atoms**: Predicting the evolution of atom positions, velocities, and charges over time within the unit cell.
3. **Molecular Dynamics in a Crystal**: Extending the simulation to include a rigid crystal structure, incorporating the positions and charges of crystal atoms.

Key concepts and techniques covered in this assignment include:
- Periodic Boundary Conditions: Handling the periodic nature of the unit cell using the minimum image convention.
- Energy and Force Calculations: Predicting the system's energy and forces guiding atom movements.
- Model Design: Ensuring model architecture aligns with the symmetries and structure of the data.
- Handling Symmetries: Considering the effects of rotations and reflections on the system's trajectories.
